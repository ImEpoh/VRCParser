A quick example of a VRChat output log parser I made for testing purposes only that I decided to release publicly because someone in the 7.5 billion might find it useful

This program gives you desktop notifications when user leaves or joins the instance you are in.
Notifications are desktop only, sorry VR users.

This program only reads a text file in the VRChat folder, it does not directly interact the VRChat client but just like anything 3rd party use it at your own risk and if you __really__ care about your VRChat account do __not__ use this program.

<sup>_(honestly I don't recommending using anything I make they are all bloated spaghetti but for some reason people like them)_</sup>

If you are not receiving desktop notifications on Windows 10 pin the executable (VRCParser.exe) into your start menu

## Notifications
Shows who joins and leaves the world in real time

## Main Window
Just shows the VRChat output log in real time, not used for anything except debugging
